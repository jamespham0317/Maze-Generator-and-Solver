# Maze Generator and Solver 

An interactive maze generator and visual pathfinding tool written in C++ using [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/). Mazes are generated and solved using a variety of algorithms with real-time animation and performance metrics.

---

## Features

- Animated visualization of generation and solving algorithms
- Displays live runtime and number of visited nodes during generation and solving
- Generators include:
  - Randomized Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Randomized Prim's Algorithm
  - Randomized Kruskal's Algorithm
- Solvers include:
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - A* Search
  - Greedy Best-First Search
  - Wall Follower (Left/Right Hand Rule)
  - Dead-End Filler
- Real-time rendering with `raylib`
- Keyboard input for switching generators and solvers
- Colored highlights for start, goal, visited, and solution paths
